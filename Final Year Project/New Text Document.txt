Human-robot interaction is not only just about humans interacting with robots, but it also includes the process of giving the robot the ability to interact with humans in a way that closely resembles human-human interaction. If humans can interact with robots similarly to how they interact with to other humans, then the bar for learning communication with robots will be lower.
How smooth can interaction between humans and robots be? Can they have good cooperation with each other? Well, human to human teamwork is still a lot smoother than robots because of experience and familiarity, but mainly because of muscle memories and routines. However, robots are now able to cooperate with humans smoothly enough to get work done without any problems. Examples of these are industries in modern times, where they use some types of robots or machines that can get the job done faster than a human, which can lessen the workload of humans.
